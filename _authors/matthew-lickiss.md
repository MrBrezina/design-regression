Matthew Lickiss is interested in where meaning is, how it changes, whether people get the message, and what they do as a result. More specifically, this relates to how information is read differently when presented across different platforms, different formats, and in different ways. Focusing on the borders, overlaps, and discourses between information design, typography, and linguistics Matthew teaches and researches at the School of Design, University of Leeds.
