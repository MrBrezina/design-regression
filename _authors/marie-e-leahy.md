Marie Leahyâ€™s interest in producing accessible texts for non-typical readers grew out of her experience of trade publishing. After studying Italian and French at Oxford, Marie joined Phaidon Press and trained as an editor of illustrated reference books. Later she worked for the Royal Collection as editor for the scholarly catalogues. Deciding eventually that she needed to know more about the theory of design, she undertook first a research MA and then a PhD in the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication at the University of Reading.  She is currently investigating which features of writing style and content are likely to be problematic for readers who have impaired literacy skills.
