Publishers have so far paid little attention to readers who have
dementia. The few books that are available tend to be large format,
highly illustrated hardbacks with limited text and a strong accent on
reminiscence. Books like these may be ideal for shared reading with
family and carers (Bate, 2014), but anecdotal evidence suggests that
experienced readers with a relatively recent diagnosis might welcome
more adventurous texts. The research outlined below describes the
studies I carried out in order to investigate whether adjusting the
design of books could help readers with a memory impairment (Leahy,
2021).

## Why Alzheimer’s disease can affect reading

Alzheimer’s disease is the most commonly occurring form of dementia
(Zahn and Burns, 2017, p. 2). It is a progressive condition and is
characterised by a particular form of memory loss that is due in part to
a deterioration in the functioning of the hippocampus, a part of the
brain that plays a vital role in working memory and in the formation of
new memories (Alzheimer, 2021). Since reading relies on the synchronous
functioning of many aspects of memory, individuals with Alzheimer’s tend
to experience a number of specific difficulties which include retaining
new information (Lleó and Blesa, 2017, p. 28 ), grasping the gist of a
text (Hudon et al., 2006), and inferring meaning from an author’s words
(Creamer and Schmitter-Edgcombe, 2010). Research suggests that the
hippocampus also plays a part in binding together the experience of
time, space and memory (Eichenbaum, 2017), which would explain the
general feeling of disorientation caused by its malfunctioning.

There is good evidence, however, that individuals who have a lifelong
habit of reading may have preserved literacy skills (Snowdon, 2003).
Stern (2012) refers to this capacity as cognitive reserve and suggests
that it “provides an explanation for differences between individuals in
susceptibility to age-related brain changes or pathology related to
Alzheimer’s disease” (p. 1006). It is also possible that reducing the
cognitive load (Sweller, 1988) placed on memory by the demands of
reading might be beneficial. Building on the reader’s learned skills
would certainly be a positive step since habits which rely on procedural
memory are not affected in the early stages of the disease (Bayles &
Tomoeda, 2013, p. 60).

## What needed to be investigated?

There is little academic literature on reading continuous prose with
dementia, so my research questions were exploratory. They were:

1.  What impact does early-stage Alzheimer’s disease have on an
    individual’s capacity to read for pleasure?
2. What can be done by book editors and designers to mitigate these
    effects?

The first of these questions was problematic since Alzheimer’s is
known to affect the individual’s capacity to communicate and to
initiate action. Moreover, there are increasingly frequent
references in the literature to “gatekeepers” -- the carers and
members of the medical profession who seek to maintain the privacy
and wellbeing of those in their charge (Brooks et al., 2017).
Academic research involving direct contact with informants therefore
requires compliance with Health Research Authority protocols in
order to meet their strict ethical requirements.

The second question involved studying the published literature in a
wide range of areas including psychology, gerontology and vision
research, and combining it with the applied research in information
design and design for accessibility. There is a growing literature
on the potential for ICT to support individuals who develop
dementia, but Alzheimer’s disease is defined by specific memory
impairments, and longitudinal research is lacking on the benefits of
e-readers in this context. I chose therefore to focus my own
research on the practical advantages of the printed book.

The academic literature suggested that adding documentary
illustrations might be a way of guiding the reader’s attention
(Tatler et al., 2010; Yarbus, 1967) and help to reinforce the ideas
expressed in a text. Work by Embree et al. (2012) suggests that
individuals in the early stages of Alzheimer’s can remember
illustrations better than words (the so-called “picture superiority
effect”). Reinforcing information by presenting it simultaneously in
two different modes -- words and images -- may therefore be a way of
supporting an impaired memory. The use of headings as advance
organisers might be a way of reducing cognitive load; Hartley and
Trueman (1983) suggest that headings can enhance recall, while
Lorch (1989) proposes that they help focus attention and thus
support comprehension. Limiting the need for inference might be
achieved by building in redundancy (Bower, 1976) or deliberate
superfluousness (Mollerup, 2013), and by using explicit punctuation
(Ritter, 1992)[.](#sn:ritter) Perhaps most significantly, research led by the University of Liverpool suggests that imaginative content and rich
vocabulary continue to be appreciated by readers with a cognitive
impairment (Davis et al., 2016). The pleasure derived from reading
is undoubtedly subjective, but personal observation suggested that
poorly presented and badly structured text would be likely to result
in reader error.

## How I organised the research

Progress in my research was gradual and incremental. Some informal
fieldwork was necessary initially, and I followed this with three formal
user-centred studies.

## Preliminary fieldwork

I carried out the fieldwork study with a wide range of volunteers who
had dementia. The study involved having informal conversations about
reading with both individuals and large groups, including members of the
Dementia Engagement and Empowerment Project (DEEP). I also listened to
the opinions of family members and carers, although the research was
focussed exclusively on the views of readers with dementia -- the
experts by experience.

The fieldwork suggested that the volunteers wanted to continue to read
despite the extra effort of concentration that was required; they were
frustrated at not being able to remember a plot and who the characters
were in a story; they tended not to blame the publisher if they found
books difficult to read and were interested in the idea that designers
could adjust the layout of a text so that it might be easier to follow.

## The research method I chose

On the basis of these initial findings, I chose a qualitative approach
for the three formal studies with the parameters of the investigation
being narrowly defined. The participants for each study were
self-declared habitual readers with a recent diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease, and the research focussed exclusively on private reading for
pleasure. I decided to draw on methods used in design ethnography as a
way of supplementing the information that participants themselves might
be able to supply (Wasson, 2000). I made audio-recordings of
conversations -- with the participants’ consent -- and I transcribed
their comments word for word in order to ensure transparency. I also
wrote up detailed notes on each encounter using the *thick description*
approach favoured by Geertz (1973, p. 6) in an effort to capture the
participants’ full meaning.

## The study materials

I drew up a detailed brief for each of the three small-scale
user-centred studies and commissioned the test materials from two
[professional designers.](#sn:professional-designers) In each case the designers prepared pairs of contrasting sample materials so that participants would only have to choose between alternative treatments.

**Participant interview study:** four pairs of layouts were prepared
showing alternative treatments of four design issues. The issues were:

-  the positioning of an illustration in the text (Figure 1a) or on the facing page (Figure 1b) in a work of fiction
-  the addition of subheadings in a piece of explanatory prose (Figures 2a and 2b)
-  the addition of speakers’ names in a page of dialogue (Figures 3a and 3b)
-  the simplification of language in a page of a literary fiction (Figures 4a and 4b)

The samples in each case were based on existing books and followed the
typography and page design of traditional texts.

**Textual additions study:** the layouts addressed the issue of
forgetting the characters in a story and forgetting the events described
in previous chapters. The layouts showed:

-  alternative presentations of a list of characters in the prelims (Figures 5a and 5b)
-  a plot summary at the end of a chapter (Figure 6a)
-  a plot summary at the start of a new chapter (Figure 6b)

The samples again adopted the design of traditional works of fiction
with the plot summaries added in a sans serif typeface and on a grey
background.

**Book cover study:** the samples tested memory-supporting additions to
a work of fiction. The additions were:

- a bookmark attached to a ribbon and providing a list of characters(Figure 7)
- a list of characters provided as a detachable strip printed on the front flap (Figure 8)
- two suggestions for a publicity sticker for the front of the book (Figure 9)

The design of the book covers was deliberately fresh and simple with a
strong reliance on typography to ensure the legibility of both the book
title and the flap copy.

## The participants and what they did

The first study had ten participants and involved talking to people on a
one-to-one basis in their homes. The second and third studies were held
as part of monthly DEEP meetings. Here the numbers were small -- three
participants for the first study and four for the second -- but each
participant had chosen to attend the meeting knowing that user research
into book design was on the agenda. At each of the two DEEP meetings I
asked simple, verbal questions addressed to the group as a whole. By
showing the participants alternative designs I hoped to reduce the need
for participants to formulate their answers as complete sentences. I
also hoped that handling the materials would prompt them to make
additional observations.

## The results

The three studies together with the preliminary fieldwork highlighted a
number of the issues raised in the published literature on reading with
dementia and confirmed recommendations made by current design research.
The studies also provided several new and perhaps unexpected findings.

**Confirmed:** participants generally appreciated a familiar page layout
with clear type, generous line-spacing and conventionally placed
signposting in the form of chapter headings and page numbers. Readers
favoured positioning illustrations just after their point of reference
in the text and noted the extra burden on memory caused by temporarily
leaving a paragraph of text to look at an image on the facing page.
Several readers noted that illustrations could also act as useful
place-holders in a long text. Readers acknowledged that structuring
information so that it could be presented beneath headings might help
comprehension, although they were aware that the result might appear
childish. Similarly, some readers were able to infer who was speaking in
a piece of dialogue and felt that repeating the speakers’ names too
often could appear heavy handed. A number of participants appreciated
the simplifying of literary texts while others felt that engaging with
the author’s writing style contributed to the satisfaction of reading.

The idea of including a list of characters at the start of a text was
welcomed. A plot summary included at regular intervals in a text was
thought to be helpful, with a preference shown for a “The Story So Far”
paragraph to be inserted at the start of each chapter.

Participants appreciated the size and feel of the sample cover. They
found the idea of providing a list of characters on a bookmark too fussy
and preferred to see the list printed on the front flap. They had no
objection to adding a publicity sticker to the front of the cover and
including the words “memory-supporting features” was not thought to be
insensitive.

**Also noted:** experienced readers showed a continued interest in
engaging with demanding texts despite their memory impairment. When
pressed for an opinion, they were not particularly critical of the
layout and typeface used in the samples but viewed the invitation to
suggest changes with interest. Participants’ main concern was with the
content of a text, and many expressed a willingness to struggle with
poor design if the narrative was sufficiently interesting. Perhaps
rather surprisingly, participants referred to their ability to visualise
people and events “in their mind’s eye”. They also continued to
appreciate humour both in conversation and on the page.

## What the results suggest

Taken together, the fieldwork and the formal studies suggest that there
are a number of adjustments which might facilitate errorless reading.
Substantial typographical modifications do not appear to be necessary
for the habitual readers who go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease.
However, it would seem to be essential to avoid any obstacles that might
interfere with a correct understanding of the text. Readers are likely
to benefit from a well-defined typeface and a page layout that is
familiar and offers prominent, conventionally positioned running heads
and page numbers. Space should be used to connect and to separate;
identical and contrasting colours may be used to indicate similarity and
difference; unnecessary decorative features may cause distraction and
need to be avoided.

Finding that informants retained their ability to visualise scenes and
people was surprising given the wide range of losses that can be caused
by strokes and brain injuries (Zeman, 2016). Research into the
commissioning of texts for readers with early-stage dementia would need
to explore this aspect of imagination, which lies at the heart of the
author/reader [collaboration.](#sn:jamie-stonebridge)

## The way forward

Publishing is a multidisciplinary exercise and producing books for any
readership requires effective teamwork. The studies showed me that
designers and editors can make useful adjustments to the content and
presentation of texts, but that the contribution of user experience is
vital when producing books that will appeal to readers with early-stage
Alzheimer’s disease.

Ritter writes in <em>The Oxford Manual of Style</em> (1992, p. 112) that
“Punctuation exists to clarify meaning in the written word and to
facilitate reading. Too much can hamper understanding through an
uneven, staccato text, while too little can lead to misreading.”
