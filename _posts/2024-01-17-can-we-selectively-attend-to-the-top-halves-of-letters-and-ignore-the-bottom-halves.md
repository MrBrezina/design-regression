## Background to the study

A primary aim of the online study was to find out if letters are
processed holistically. This would mean that we attend to all parts of a
letter at the same time, we cannot selectively attend, and we are
sensitive to spatial relations among parts. Research on face perception
has demonstrated that faces are perceived holistically (e.g. [Farah, Wilson, Drain, & Tanaka, 1998](#ref:farah-wilson-drain-tanaka-1998)).

A second motivation for the study was to see whether designers differ
from non-designers in how they process letters, holistically or as
separate features. Research with art students has found less holistic
processing of faces than ordinary observers ([Zhou, Cheng, Zang & Wong, 2012](#ref:zhou-cheng-zang-wong-2012)). This is explained by the art students’ additional experience in
drawing faces and attending to parts of a face. In a similar manner,
letter designers (e.g. typeface designers, calligraphers, lettering
artists) attend to parts of letters. We therefore predicted that
designers, and in particular letter designers, might not process letters
holistically, whereas non-designers would process letters holistically.

## What we did

### Tasks

We asked participants in the study to categorise themselves as a
non-designer or a graphic designer, typographer, letter designer, or
other designer.

Participants were asked to look at a series of two letters, presented
one after the other, with a [pattern mask](#sn:pattern-mask) in between. The task was to
say whether the top halves of the two letters were identical. The
response options were ‘Sure same’, ‘Probably same’, ‘Probably different’, ‘Sure different’.
To avoid any ambiguity as to what was meant by the top half, there was a horizontal line through the middle of the letters. See [Figure 1](#fig:one).

### The letters

A variable font was designed that varied contrast (low to high) and
terminals (simple cut-off terminals to flared to serifs). Letters were
composed of two halves and designed so the tops and the bottoms of all
combinations connect smoothly in the middle. They were designed as
monospaced letters for consistency of presentation in the task. See
[Figure 2](#fig:two).

<figcaption id="fig:two"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Reading across the rows, the top halves of the letters remain
the same and the bottom changes. Reading down the columns, the top
halves of the letters change, and the bottom halves remain the same. The
diagonal, from top left to bottom right, contains letters where the
variation is applied to both the top and bottom of the letter. These are
labelled ‘normal’ letters in contrast to the ‘composite’ letters where
the top and bottom come from different versions of the normal letters.</figcaption>

To test for holistic processing, a comparison is made between two
conditions:

1. pairs of letters where the relationship between the two bottom
   halves of the letters is inconsistent with the relationship between
   the top halves (incongruent letter pairs)

2. pairs of letters where there is a consistent relationship (congruent
   letter pairs)

- If we are able to attend to only the top halves of letters, and
  ignore the bottom halves of letters, then we should not be confused
  by 1) where there is an incongruence.

- If we process letters holistically, and we cannot not attend to the
  bottom halves (we attend to the whole letter) then we will make more
  errors in 1) than in 2).

The four categories of letter pairs are shown in [Figures 3a–3d](#fig:three-a)[](#sn:congruent-categories):

### Timing

The study included a practice set of trials followed by the main
session. The practice was included to familiarise participants with the
procedure and to set the speed of presenting the letters. It was
important to ensure that the task was neither too easy nor too
difficult. By piloting the study, we realised that there might be quite
big differences in the level of difficulty between designers and
non-designers; the latter are less used to discriminating between fonts.

We included 16 practice trials using letters “d”,
“u”, and “l” where we varied the speed at which we presented the letters
starting at 800 msecs, then increasing the speed in steps to 200 msecs
and then back to 800 msecs. The proportion of correct responses was
calculated, and this was used to set a consistent speed for the main
part of the study. The main part used a different set of letters:
“a, b, c, e, h, j, l, n, p, q, r, t, z”.

### Participants

A total of 229 people completed the online study and were broken down
into:

|                                | Count |
|--------------------------------|-------|
| Non-designers                  | 118   |
| Graphic designers              | 47    |
| Letter designers               | 36    |
| Typographers                   | 7     |
| Other designers                | 21    |
|--------------------------------|-------|

## What we found

### Holistic processing

The ability to discriminate between same and different pairs is measured
using [AUC](#sn:AUC) which is free of response bias, such as responding ‘same’
most of the time. Overall, the congruent pairs were easier to
discriminate than the incongruent pairs. This means that the letters
were processed holistically.

The results broken down by participant group are shown in [Figure 4](#fig:four).
Although the size of the difference between congruent and incongruent
pairs varies across groups, the only statistically significant
differences are between:

- graphic designers and other designers
- letter designers and other designers

In both cases, there is a larger difference between congruent and
incongruent pairs in other designers, i.e. stronger evidence of holistic
processing in other designers. There is larger variation among other
designers with the [incongruent pairs](#sn:incongruent-pairs) which suggests that some
participants may have found this condition particularly challenging.

Although typographers appear not to process letters holistically
(similar discrimination of congruent and incongruent pairs), this result
is not reliably different from the other groups because there are so few
participants who categorised themselves as typographers (N=7).

The difference between congruent and incongruent pairs for all of the
designer groups is not significantly smaller than the difference for
non-designers. Designers generally process letters in a similar manner
to non-designers, holistically, rather than attending to parts of the
letter.

incongruent indicates holistic processing. The standard error bars

### Further comparisons across groups of participants

Although we aimed to achieve a similar level of performance in designers
and non-designers, by adjusting the speed of presenting the letters, we
did find that graphic designers, letter designers, and typographers were
better at detecting the differences than non-designers. Letter designers
were better than graphic designers and other designers. See [Figure 5](#fig:five).

The speed of presenting the letters can also be compared across groups
([Figure 6](#fig:six)). The non-designers received longer presentation times than
graphic designers and letter designers. This is expected as they would
be likely to get fewer correct responses during the practice trials.
Other designers also received longer presentation times than letter
designers.

## Possible explanations

We found evidence for holistic processing of letters in non-designers
and designers. The responses of other designers appear to be rather
different from the rest of the designer groups. But as we do not have
any further information on the characteristics of this group, it is
difficult to explain the results.

We may conclude that designers and non-designers process letters in the
same way. However, an alternative interpretation is that, although the
outcomes are the same, they are achieved by using different strategies.
As experts in the analysis of letters, letter/typographic/graphic
designers may have focused on the spatial relationships between letter
features, e.g. the relative position of thick and thin strokes. As
experts in letter perception, non-designers may have viewed the whole
letter, as in reading, because it is a familiar shape.

Future work may explore whether changes to the nature of the task reveal
differences in strategy.
