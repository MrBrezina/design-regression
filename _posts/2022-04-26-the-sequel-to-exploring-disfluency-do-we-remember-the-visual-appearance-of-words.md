We described our study exploring disfluency in a [previous
article]({% post_url 2021-05-18-exploring-disfluency-are-designers-too-sensitive-to-harder-to-read-typefaces %}) and conference presentation at the
[ICTVC](https://ictvc.org/2019/en/) conference in Patras in June 2019. In that study we explored whether designers’ greater sensitivity to typographic presentation might influence their judgments of memory for items set in a less legible font (Sans Forgetica) and how well they identify and remember words. We did find that designers’ judgments of memory were influenced more by the legibility of items compared with non-designers. However, there was no difference in the accuracy of responses in either group. Sans Forgetica items were not easier to remember, as predicted by disfluency theory.

## Summary

Our second study further explores designers’ sensitivity to visual
aspects of text. We investigate whether the representation of an item in
memory includes the font styling and if this differs between designers
and non-designers. Does changing the font between initial reading of an
item and its subsequent presentation impair recognition of the item? We
conclude that there is some evidence that the font styling is retained
in memory when reading, but this requires further research.

## Why did we do this research?

[Our first study]({% post_url 2021-05-18-exploring-disfluency-are-designers-too-sensitive-to-harder-to-read-typefaces %})
(referred to as study 1 below) had two parts which consisted of two
consecutive tasks: lexical decision and recognition (see [Figures 1](#fig:screen-lexical) and [2](#fig:screen-recognition). For detailed description see the section ‘[What we
did]({% post_url 2021-05-18-exploring-disfluency-are-designers-too-sensitive-to-harder-to-read-typefaces %}#what-we-did)’
in the report of study 1. Each part of study 1 used one font, either
Arial or Sans Forgetica, for both tasks. We realised this study design
could also be used to explore what happens if the font changes between
the two tasks, if the lexical task is in one font and the subsequent
recognition task is in another (see [Figures 1](#fig:screen-lexical) and [2](#fig:screen-recognition)). Is recognition of
a word or non-word more difficult if the visual appearance of the item
does not match how it was previously seen? Might designers be more likely to remember the visual representation, the font used to style the text, than non-designers?

### Existing academic research on memory representations 

A distinction has been made between graphemic and semantic analyses
([Kolers, 1975](#ref:kolers-1975), [1976](#ref:kolers-1976)). This distinction is also described as perceptual and conceptual, respectively. A representation in memory which preserves information about the graphemic or perceptual features of text (e.g. font styling) is contrasted with a representation which contains only conceptual information about the meaning of the text ([Sheridan & Reingold, 2012](#ref:sheridan-reingold-2021)).

A technique which is typically used to explore whether a previous item
can influence the response to a subsequent item is called *priming*. If
the first item activates a particular representation in memory, and
there is a partial match with the subsequent item, the response can be
facilitated, i.e. responses are faster. With respect to the
representations mentioned above, priming may be perceptual or
conceptual. The degree of facilitation depends on the match between the
two presentations ([Roediger & Blaxton, 1987](#ref:roediger-blaxton-1987)). Some researchers have found reduced perceptual priming with font style changes, because of the mismatch between the visual representations of corresponding items ([Jacoby & Hayman, 1987](#ref:jacoby-1987); [Roediger & Blaxton, 1987](#ref:roediger-blaxton-1987)) but others have found
no difference ([Rajaram & Roediger, 1993](#ref:rajram-roediger-1993)). There is therefore a question
as to whether font styling is represented in memory in [some way.](#sn:note-1)

### Existing academic research on differences due to training

We are not aware of any academic research which has specifically
explored the effect of design expertise on memory for font styling. But
anecdotally, since designers are trained to discriminate among font
styles, we might predict that they would be more likely to attend to the
perceptual features and this might affect the representation in memory.

## Our research questions:

- Is the visual appearance of items preserved in memory and does this
affect recognition? If the font styling is represented in memory
together with the conceptual information (meanings), recognition may be
slower and/or less accurate when the font used to set items in the
recognition task is different from the one used in the lexical decision
task.
- Is this different for designers and non-designers?

## What we did

We described the format of these studies in our previous article
‘Exploring disfluency: Are designers too sensitive to harder-to-read
typefaces?’. The only difference in format between the current study and study 1 is that here we changed the font between the lexical decision and recognition tasks (see [Figure 3](#fig:schema)). Our analysis includes a comparison with the results of study 1 in order to address the research questions.

## Our participants

We had 122 participants in this study. We grouped the various categories
of designers together to form two groups with 63 designers and 59
non-designers.

## What we found in study 2

### Disfluency

Many results were the same as study 1. Again, participants judged Sans
Forgetica as less legible than [Arial,](#sn:note-2) and thought they would be
better at remembering items in Arial than in [Sans Forgetica.](#sn:note-3) Items
in Sans Forgetica were responded to more slowly than items in Arial for
both [tasks.](#sn:note-4) There were no differences in accuracy of responses to
Arial and Sans Forgetica in either [task.](#sn:note-5)

### Changing font

When compared with the results of study 1, participants were worse at
remembering items when the font changed between lexical decision and
[recognition.](#sn:note-6) However, participants also got fewer word or non-word
decisions correct in this second study, compared to [study 1.](#sn:note-7) As the
lexical decision task is a stand-alone task, this should not be affected
by the change of font in the recognition items.

### Designers and non-designers

In this study, differences between judgments of memory for the two fonts
did not differ quite as much between designers and [non-designers,](#sn:note-8)
but the pattern was the same. The difference between judgments of memory
for Arial and Sans Forgetica in designers was slightly larger than in
non-designers.

As in study 1, designers responded more quickly than non-designers in
the recognition [task.](#sn:note-9) But, unlike study 1, there was no difference
between designers and non-designers in speed of responding in the
lexical decision [task.](#sn:note-10) A new finding was that designers were less
accurate in their lexical decision and recognition responses than
[non-designers.](#sn:note-11) The designers in this study were also less accurate
in their responses to the lexical decision task than the designers in
the first [study.](#sn:note-12)

### Words vs non-words

As in study 1, responses to words were faster than non-words for both
[tasks.](#sn:note-13) Also, in both tasks, the responses to non-words were slowed
down more compared to words when they were set in Sans Forgetica.[](#sn:note-14)
In study 1, both groups of participants remembered non-words better than
words. However, in this study only non-designers were better at remembering non-words, remembering more non-words than [designers](#sn:note-15) (see [Figure 4](#fig:auc)).

    ></div>

<figcaption id="fig:auc"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Non-designers are more accurate at remembering non-words. The accuracy of responses is measured using AUC which is free of response bias, such as responding ‘seen’ most of the time.</figcaption>

## What do these results tell us?

We have replicated some of our results from study 1 regarding Sans
Forgetica. Items set in this font in the lexical decision task are
considered less legible and less memorable than items set in Arial, and
slow down reading. But accuracy of responses in both tasks is not
affected by the font; there is no [*disfluency effect*.](#sn:note-16)

Changing the font appears to make the second study more challenging than
study 1. As items were less well remembered in this study, the visual
appearance (font styling) of items may be represented in memory, along
with meaning. In study 1, recognition may have been easier because of
the perceptual match between items in the two tasks. However, we would
not expect the lexical decision task to be more difficult, as this
should not be affected by the change in font in the subsequent
recognition items. The reduction in accuracy of lexical decisions may
reflect an unsettling effect of changing fonts, which might be
experienced when reaching the second part of the [study.](#sn:note-17) Recognition was poorer in the second part of the study, perhaps due to interference from items seen in the first part. This result was not found in study 1 and may again reflect the greater difficulty of this second study.

In the lexical decision task of study 1, participants were slower to
respond to non-words in Sans Forgetica, compared with Arial. In the
second study, this applied to the recognition task as well. As discussed
in the previous report (section ‘[What do these results
tell us?]({% post_url 2021-05-18-exploring-disfluency-are-designers-too-sensitive-to-harder-to-read-typefaces %}#what-do-these-results-tell-us)’),
non-words in Sans Forgetica need more time to decipher than words
because we cannot use our knowledge of words to fill in the letters that
are harder to identify. Note that in this second study, the non-words
were set in a different font in the lexical decision task and the
recognition task. Seeing them first in Sans Forgetica and needing to
recognise them set in Arial did not seem to have an effect, but seeing
them first in Arial and needing to recognise them in Sans Forgetica
slowed participants’ responses down. This asymmetry cannot be explained
solely by the change in the visual representation from one font to
another resulting in reduced perceptual priming. Letter identification
seems to be further slowed down by the non-word being set in the less
legible Sans Forgetica after it has been processed in the more legible
Arial.

The differences between designers and non-designers in their speed of
responding and accuracy of answers might indicate different approaches
to the task. It is possible that the variability introduced by changing
the font between tasks affected the two groups in different ways. The
designers in this study contrast with the non-designers by appearing to
prioritise speed over accuracy, particularly in the recognition task.

Between study 1 and this study, the small difference in the Judgment of
Memory results for designers and non-designers stems from designers
slightly decreasing their judgments of the difference between the two
fonts and non-designers slightly increasing their judgments of the
difference. In both studies, within each group of designers, there is
quite a lot of variation in the size of the difference between their
Judgment of Memory for Arial and Judgment of Memory for Sans Forgetica.
Non-designers are less variable. Looking at the breakdown into
categories of designers, the first study has a prevalence of letter
designers, whereas the second study includes more graphic designers (see
[Figure 5](#fig:professional-training)). This indicates that letter designers may be even more
sensitive to font differences than graphic designers, which makes sense.

<figcaption id="fig:professional-training"><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Breakdown of number of participants by professional training across the two studies. Study 1 includes more letter designers than other categories of designer whereas study 2 includes more graphic designers.</figcaption>

## Comment on the results of the two studies

Although items in Arial were judged consistently as more memorable and
easier to read, these items were not better remembered. The nature of
the lexical decision task, and the instruction to proceed as quickly and
accurately as possible, may have deterred more effortful processing of
Sans Forgetica. However, slower responses to items in Sans Forgetica
suggest that greater effort was needed. The lack of a positive effect on
memory from less legible fonts is not too surprising as there is only
weak evidence that hard-to-read materials enhance [learning.](#sn:note-18)

We make no claims that we are looking at ‘normal reading’. Non-words
were incorporated in the studies purely as a tool for exploring memory
for [words.](#sn:note-19) The unexpected benefit of including non-words is that
these highlighted the problems of using a less legible font. With
non-words, readers must rely on letter identification without any
contribution from word-level information, i.e. knowledge of the
language. This confirms that designers should use legible fonts for
texts where readers are less familiar with the vocabulary, e.g. low
frequency (unusual) words, as less legible fonts will increase the
difficulty of reading such words.

Reading research looking at typographic variables is typically concerned
with ease and efficiency of reading and not measuring learning. Our
studies tested memory after a short delay and was therefore not a test
of long-term retention. However, our studies suggest that the best
strategy when designing texts where the content needs to be retained is
for designers to use legible fonts to minimize the effort readers need
to put in. This would apply to educational materials and lengthy
stories, for example.

There is some evidence that the font styling is retained in memory when
reading, but this requires further research.

Some interesting and unexplained differences emerged between the
designers and non-designers. In almost all cases, the divergence was not
in response to the different fonts, which we might have expected, but a
more general difference in strategy or approach to the tasks. It is
feasible that this difference is a result of designers’ professional
training.
